# PRODIGY_SD_04
This repository contains the code and documentation for Task 4 of my Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
# SUMMARY OF THIS TASK
This code implements in Python the "Sudoku Solver" using the backtracking method and presents it via a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter library. In verifying placing a digit into particular cell, solver also checks whether that number is already in a same row, column or 3x3 subgrid. When number substitution is active, entire network is tried to be filled repeatedly and if it fails then backs off due to invalid situation. The user interface created in `SudokuApp` class gives 9 by 9 grid where users can put their own Sudokus. In starting solution process the button “Solve Sudoku” after which if it exists will appear on same page together with the one for Sudoku puzzle entered by user. The interface contains were changing colors to highlight the user’s input and thus improving accessibility and friendliness of use. If there is no way out from the Sudoku problem, a program notifies its owner by sending him message through computer’s screen notification system. Algorithmic logic blends well with interactive UI, rendering this project functional as well as having fun aspects for visitors.
